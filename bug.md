# Bug Report: Beat Timeline Feels Random / Metronome-Like

## Summary
Gameplay notes did not reliably follow the musical groove of uploaded songs.  
Players reported that note timing felt either too evenly spaced (like a metronome) or matched seemingly random parts of the track instead of the natural beat a person would tap or stomp to.

## User-Facing Symptoms
- Notes appeared at timings that did not match obvious kick/snare pulse.
- Some songs felt locked to a constant pulse even when the music phrasing suggested different emphasis.
- In groove-heavy tracks, note placement felt inconsistent and hard to predict musically.
- Gameplay could feel “technically timed” but not musically satisfying.

## Reproduction
1. Upload a song with clear rhythmic accents and groove.
2. Start gameplay in any mode/difficulty.
3. Compare on-screen note timing with the beat a listener would naturally tap.

## Expected Behavior
- Notes should align with musically meaningful beat positions.
- The rhythm should feel natural and groove-consistent across sections.
- Chart timing should feel intentional rather than random.

## Actual Behavior
- Note timing alignment was inconsistent with perceived beat accents.
- Beat placement often felt rigid or arbitrarily selected.

## Impact
- Reduced gameplay quality and player trust in rhythm accuracy.
- Higher frustration despite correct player input.
- Weaker connection between music analysis and game feel.

## Status
Resolved.
